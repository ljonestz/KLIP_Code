# Code for KLIP report and analysis

This repository contains code required to generate the KLIP dataset and produce relevant analytics (including graphs and tables). 

Data aggregation, analysis and plot generation are all carried out by running 'KLIP_code.R' in the Code folder. Individual plots and tables are saved seperately in the respective folders.

The raw KLIP datasets are not included in this respository and must be loaded separately in order to run the scipts successfully
